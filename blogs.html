                        <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that helps you align elements easily. It allows
                            items to grow, shrink, and wrap to fit responsive designs.</p>
                        <p>You can control alignment along the main and cross axes using properties like
                            `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap`.</p>
                        <p>This is especially useful for building navbars, card layouts, and adaptive UI components.</p>
                        <p>Mastering flexbox gives you powerful control over your layouts with minimal CSS code.</p>

                        <p>Git is a version control system that tracks code changes and allows collaboration. It

                        <p>Learning Git commands like `commit`, `push`, `pull`, and `merge` is essential for modern
                            development practices.</p>
                        <p>Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket make remote collaboration and code reviews
                            seamless.</p>
                        <p>If you're working in any team project, Git is a must-have skill in your toolkit.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language that brings interactivity to your websites. It
                            runs in the browser and can respond to user actions.</p>
                        <p>With JavaScript, you can build sliders, dropdowns, modals, and form validations. It also
                            powers frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.</p>
                        <p>Start by learning variables, loops, functions, and events. Then move to DOM manipulation and
                            APIs.</p>
                        <p>Once comfortable, explore tools like Node.js to run JS on the backend as well.</p>
